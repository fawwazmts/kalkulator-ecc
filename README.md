Kalkulator Elliptic Curve Cryptography is project Cryptography course.
This project has 4 feature, those are:

- determine the set of elliptic curve points defined on the elliptic curve
- calculates the sum of two elliptic curve points defined on the elliptic curve
- calculates the spreading of elliptic curve points defined on the elliptic curve
- calculate the elliptic curve diffie hellman public key and secret key.

This project can be accessed online using [Kalkulator ECC](https://kalkulator-ecc.netlify.app/).
